Here is a simple, console based project.

The goal of this game of 64 cards representing one of the 8 kinds of critters, is to avoid having 4 of the same creature.

1. The card are distributed trough the players (2 to 6)
2. The youngest player start
3. The current player pick a card from his hand, place it face down, designates another player and call the name of a critters(e.g. it's a cockroach).
4. The designated player can either accept or refuse the card
   3.1 if he accept, he call truth or false on the name called for the card. If he is right the player who gave the card has to keep it in front of him face up, if not the designated player has to keep the card face up.
   3.2 if he refuse, he designates another player and can confirm the previous name call or say another name(e.g. no it's a bug!)
5. same rules as 3 but if the card keep on being passed on and there is only one player who hasn't seen the card, he is forced to take it and do 3.1
6. The player who put a card face up in front of him start the next turn ==> 3

The game is over if one player is out of card in his hand or if one player has 4 of the same critters in front of him. In both case, the player lost and everyone else won.
